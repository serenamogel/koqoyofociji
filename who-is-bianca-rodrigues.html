Bianca Rodrigues was the first person who was married to <strong>Kayce Dutton</strong>. Grimes is pretty well-known, but he has been able to keep his personal life quiet. That is one of the main reasons why you wouldn’t have been able to tell who his wife was by her name.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Who Is Bianca Rodrigues?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Bianca Rodrigues Grimes was born in Brazil on August 9, 1996.<strong> She is a model.</strong> She used to live in Brazil before she moved to the U.S. to become a model.

Luke also wants to be a country music singer in addition to being an actor.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Bianca lives in Montana while her husband films in Yellowstone, but she was born in Brazil. Her Instagram feed also has a lot of pictures of her modeling. Since at least 2016, she has posed in a lot of different places, like on the beach in a black bikini and in a studio that looks like it came straight out of the 1950s.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Bianca Rodrigues And Luke Grimes Completed 4 Years Together!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>On November 21, 2018, Bianca Rodrigues and Luke Grimes exchanged vows.

We know it is, and that is exactly what is going on with <strong>Buck and Zelda</strong>, the cats that live with the Grimes family.
