The pair never tied the knot because Richards had fallen in love with Umansky.</p><p class=fh>The lovebirds did not waste any time in making things official between themselves. Barely two years after meeting for the first time, Richards and Umansky exchanged marriage vows in 1996.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>KYLE RICHARDS' CHILDREN</strong></p><p class=fh>At the time of their wedding, Richards was already four months pregnant with their first child together, daughter Alexia, 24.
