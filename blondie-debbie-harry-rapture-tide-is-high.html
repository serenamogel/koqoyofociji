"I first heard 'The Tide Is High' on a compilation tape that someone had given me while we were in London.

The plaintive love song was originally recorded in 1967 by his trio The Paragons. On the original version, “White Rum” Raymond’s plaintive violin weaves throughout the song of unrequited love, giving it a whimsical edge.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/john-lennon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Lennon" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">John Lennon</a> was a huge fan of “The Tide is High.’’ "The one modern song I remember him listening to was 'The Tide Is High' by Blondie, which he played constantly," his son <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/sean-lennon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Sean class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Sean</a> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-sean-lennon-105993/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">told Rolling Stone</a> in 2006.

I’m completely in awe of great rappers.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Rapture” was the first time many Americans were exposed to this new art form. “U-God and Inspectah Deck from the Wu-Tang Clan once told me that ‘Rapture’ was the first rap song they ever heard as kids,” Stein told the New York Post. “That’s mind-boggling.”</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Reggae and rap artists banned together to fight the mainstream music culture</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For many in the punk scene, reggae and rap artists were fellow musical mates in the fight against the mainstream. Harry was a regular at London clothing store Acme Attractions, along with punk rockers like <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/patti-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Patti Smith" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Patti Smith</a> and Chrissie Hynde.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was a culture that spoke in a currency with which the punks could identify," Letts told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/oct/24/artsfeatures4 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Guardian class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Guardian</a>. "It was the soundbite-type lyrics, the anti-fashion fashion, the rebel stance and, importantly, the fact that reggae was a kind of musical reportage, talking about things that mattered."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unfortunately, Autoamerican would be Blondie’s last great success. In 1982, things came to a head during a show at the Providence Civic Center when bandmates threw drumsticks at each other during a fight. They would break up shortly after. But their groundbreaking hits would live on, encouraging people to enjoy and explore life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJomaWnnpm2pnnDnpmboZVitaK%2B0bJkq5mgqcKzsYytoJ2dXZ7AbrTIoJ8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kyle-secor-bio-age-height-family-wife-children-net-worth-career-party-of-five.html>&#171;&nbsp;kyle secor Bio, Age Height, Family, Wife, Children, Net worth, Career, Party of Five</a>
