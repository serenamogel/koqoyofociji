She was the second of five children and by her early teens had taken to the stage, performing primarily as a vaudeville artist and singer on the tent show circuit. After marrying singer William “Pa” Rainey in 1904, the pair developed a duo, known as Ma and Pa Rainey, although they would later divorce.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rainey’s early musical influences were the popular vaudeville, minstrel and cabaret music of the era, but during her early touring days, she was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/obituaries/ma-rainey-overlooked.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=exposed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">exposed</a> to a new form of music, soon to be known as the blues. She quickly became one of the music’s earliest and most influential interpreters, and in turn influenced a generation of blues singers, including the legendary Smith, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/bessie-smith-ma-rainey-biography data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="who Rainey mentored in her early years" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">who Rainey mentored in her early years</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her deep, brassy voice and “moaning” singing style quickly gained her fans, as did her frank, sometimes bawdy lyrics, which often explored her personal experiences, including her bisexuality and attraction to women, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/obituaries/ma-rainey-overlooked.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the subject of a number of her songs" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the subject of a number of her songs</a>. She also captivated audiences with her stage presence, featuring flashy clothes, wigs and jewelry, a row of gold-capped teeth and an energetic singing and dancing style that sparked a short-lived dance craze called the “Black Bottom” after one of her songs, and which was later used as the title of Wilson’s play.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom' takes place on one day in 1927</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The only one of Wilson’s “Pittsburg Cycle” to take place outside of that city, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a34422255/ma-rainey-true-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the play is set inside a recording studio" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the play is set inside a recording studio</a> on the South Side of Chicago, where Rainey had settled in the early 1920s. She was near the height of her fame, frequently touring the country and performing with musicians including King Oliver and a young Armstrong.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1923, she signed a contract with Paramount Records, becoming one of the first musical artists to record her songs for posterity. But for Black musicians of the day, commercial and popular success often failed to lead to financial security. Tour promoters frequently tried to avoid properly compensating performers, and in the early years of the recording industry, many Black stars signed away not only future royalties to their recordings but often ownership of the songs themselves to white record companies and producers, a form of exploitation and cultural theft faced by Black artists for decades to come.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Wilson delves the racial, economic and cultural conflicts of this period in his play</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the heart of Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is Rainey’s determination to stay true to her roots in the face of criticism of her independent streak and domineering personality by her white producer and manager. Her shrewd business sense and determination to avoid the financial pitfalls of other performers mark her out as a difficult diva. For them, Rainey is little more than a cash machine, even if she is one of the most popular entertainers of the time. As she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-06-30-9706300008-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=notes class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">notes</a>, "They don't care nothing about me. All they want is my voice.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The success of Rainey and other traditional, “country” blues performers did little to protect them from the pressure to record music with a broader commercial appeal. It’s a clash depicted in Black Bottom between not only Rainey and the record company, but from within her own band, as musician Levee, desperately longing for respect and recognition in an era of racial oppression, considers turning away from music born of, and steeped in, both an affirmation of Black life and the struggle for Black self-determination.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rainey’s career was short-lived</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As the play depicts, musical tastes were indeed changing. Despite recording more than 100 songs in a five-year period in the late 1920s, Rainey’s career declined as jazz and other forms of popular music took center stage, and the economic downturn of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Great Depression" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Great Depression</a> led to decline in touring opportunities. Rainey effectively retired in 1935, returning home to Georgia where she managed local theaters until her death in 1939.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Because many of her Paramount recordings were of inferior audio quality, her music slipped into obscurity for decades, before they were reissued in the 1960s, helping her posthumously reclaim her role as one of the most important and influential blues musicians and earning her inductions into both the Blues Foundation’s Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVopJplopa2r7HYrGSbpJGYuG6uzq2rqKVdp7KiuIysq6iqqWKutrPUrKtmr5mhwLC6</p></div><div id=links><a href=./traci-lords-net-worth-2024-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Traci Lords Net Worth 2024</a>
