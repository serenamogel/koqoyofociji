All numbers in the text are updated to reflect pricing at the time of writing.</p><h2>Best PC Power Supplies: Holiday 2023</h2><p>Now that you've picked out&nbsp;your CPU, it's time to start picking out the rest of your system components. And perhaps the most humble but overlooked of these components is the power supply unit (PSU). Available in a wide range of sizes and power capacities, there are a number of great PSUs out there, but choosing between them can be a challenge. So today we're bringing you our annual PC power supply guide, to help you sort figure out what the best options are, be it a low-wattage unit for a small form factor PC, or a hulking kilowatt unit for the most powerful PC.</p><p>When shopping for a PSU, it is very important to be aware of your system’s power consumption and to consider any planned upgrades. All current computer PSUs are designed to deliver optimal performance at (or almost at) half load. Conversely however, it is a common misconception that a more powerful PSU will be a better choice, as the power quality and efficiency of all modern PSUs dwindles at very low loads. This is especially true at the low-end of the loading curve, usually below 15% of the unit's rated capacity, where efficiency outright plummets. In fact, only the 80Plus Titanium guidelines dictate a low-load standard, and that's an efficiency requirement of 90% at 10% load. Therefore, the choice of a too powerful PSU will result in poorer performance, which can be significantly worse than what a properly-sized product at a fraction of the price would deliver.</p><p>Overall, we've split our recommendations into five main wattage categories with at least two units for each. One selection will be based on the maximum possible value (e.g. bang for the buck) and one will focus on the best overall performance.</p><p>The market for power supplies has been a bit stale up until the last 18 months or so, as manufacturers were struggling to meaningfully improve their designs without driving up their costs. However, the interest on power supplies has been rekindled by the announcement of the ATX 3.0 standard, which brought significant changes – and marketing opportunities. The recent disclosure of Intel's ATX 3.1 Design Guide has further intensified discussions in the industry. While products fully compliant with this guide are not yet available on the market, it has fundamentally determined that power supply units (PSUs) must adhere to at least the ATX 3.0 standard to power contemporary high-end graphics cards, as the 12VHPWR (or, soon to be, 12V-6x6 connector) is becoming a necessity.</p><p>The trade-off to that has been that the focus of these releases has predominantly been on the development of high-wattage units. These are designed to support systems utilizing the 12VHPWR connector, leading to a scarcity of new offerings in the low-wattage range. The following paragraphs expand on the proper selection of a PSU and details on why these units are our recommendations.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21134/2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3>How much power do I really need?</h3><p>Overall, the best way to select a PSU is based on both objective (e.g. wattage, performance) and subjective (e.g. design, modular cables) parameters. This admittedly does require every builder to be capable of making at least an educated guess about the power requirements of the system. However, this is where our guide and advice come in.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest mistake that many users make in selecting PSUs is overrating the power requirements of their systems. It is not uncommon for people – even store salespersons and experienced builders – to recommend a 1kW unit to a user with just one mid-to-high-range video card. A system with a single mainstream CPU and a matching video card rarely require more than 550 Watts. A modern, mid-range AMD Ryzen-based system with a single AMD RX 7600/NVIDIA GTX 3060 card will hardly reach up to 350 Watts, while it usually idles at 45-55 Watts. And even in a more extreme scenario - say the rather power-hungry Core i9-14900K paired with a GeForce RTX 4090 - is going to stop short of 800W except in the most pathological of workloads. Therefore, many users end up purchasing units meant to power beasts like the GeForce RTX 4090, which requires roughly 450 Watts all by itself.</p><p>Meanwhile "wattage calculators", though an improvement from blindly guessing, are usually simple tools that get their numbers from the design power (TDP) specifications of components. The TDP of a component does not represent the actual power requirements of a component - it’s at best a broad guideline - and it also is next to impossible to place every single component of a system under maximum stress simultaneously. However, keep in mind that a PSU needs to operate at around half load for optimal performance. With that in mind, while the recommendations of online tools and calculators may be overestimated, they're not overly so. Selecting a unit of the wattage they recommend is not usually a bad idea, as the recommendation usually is twice the actual power requirements of the system. The common mistake is that users usually seek to buy a significantly more powerful unit, thinking that having extra power helps, and end up with a severely oversized PSU for their system that will be both more expensive to purchase and unable to perform as it should.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21134/1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>If you can measure the actual power requirements of your system, keep in mind that you should not buy a unit that will frequently operate near its maximum capacity. Just as you would not run your car constantly near the red line, a PSU should not be under maximum stress for prolonged periods. A high quality PSU can withstand it, but just because it can does not mean it should. Again, all switching PSUs deliver their maximum efficiency at roughly 50% of their rated capacity. Running a PSU at over 90% capacity for prolonged periods will not only reduce its performance but will also make it hotter, and louder, and decrease its expected lifespan.</p><h2>ATX Power Supply Units</h2><h3>EVGA 400 N1 (<a href=#>$36</a>)</h3><p>In the sub-500W power supply unit category, which is characterized by a paucity of options and limited competition, the EVGA 400 N1 stands out as a noteworthy selection.
