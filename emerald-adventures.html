These events led to Emerald developing a complex about his height and a dislike of Pokémon. To get over his height issues, he used hair gel to style his hair upwards and wore various gadgets and clothing to make himself look taller than he actually is. He stops wearing these gadgets as well as his upwards hairstyle in the <a href=# title="Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire arc (Adventures)"><i>Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire</i> arc</a>.</p><p>The constant moving from family member to family member led to Emerald developing the ability to determine a Pokémon's birthplace.

After winning and obtaining the Guts Symbol, Emerald and his Pokémon passed out from exhaustion and are taken to a hotel room by Greta and Todd.

Emerald faced off against Ruby and won while Tucker defeated Sapphire, allowing both to face each other in the finals. Finding Ruby and Sapphire's constant talk about bonding with Pokémon annoying, Emerald had them kicked out of the Dome and decided to switch his party out, stating that he'd be insulting his Pokémon if he bonded with them.

Spenser explained that in order to battle against him, Emerald must use three trusted Pokémon and have them fight without his commands. Before their battle could begin, Spenser received a call from his fellow Brains revealing that Guile managed to capture Jirachi and has sent an army of rental Pokémon to attack the public. Putting his trust in Sceptile, Sudowoodo, and Dusclops, Emerald left them behind and went with Ruby, Sapphire, and Noland to confront Guile at the <a href=# title="Battle Tower (Generation III)">Battle Tower</a>.

After battling through various virtual Trainers, Emerald finally made it to the final floor, where he faced off against Anabel, who had been put under Guile's mind control. After Emerald was defeated, Latios appeared and returned Emerald's other three Pokémon, who had successfully obtained the Spirit Symbol. Using his Sight Sharing, Latios relayed a message from Spenser, who revealed that he came in contact with the <a href=# title="Blue Orb">Blue Orb</a> in the past and gained the ability to detect others like him, which included Guile.

Emerald and the others were assisted by Crystal alongside <a href=# title="Gold (Adventures)">Gold</a>, another <a href=# title=Johto>Johto</a> Pokédex holder. The two revealed that their fellow Pokédex holders were turned to stone and the only way of reviving them was Jirachi. While Crystal and Gold kept the Kyogre monster busy, Emerald was tasked with making the wish to revive the petrified Pokédex holders, but Jirachi refused his wish and flew away. Afterward, the Hoenn Pokédex holders trained to learn the Ultimate Moves, <a href=# title="Frenzy Plant (move)">Frenzy Plant</a>, <a href=# title="Hydro Cannon (move)">Hydro Cannon</a>, and <a href=# title="Blast Burn (move)">Blast Burn</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS330>The Final Battle III</a></i>, Emerald struggled to focus with the training. At Ruby and Sapphire's suggestion, Emerald revealed his past and how he obtained a Pokédex, got his mechanical suit, and got the mission to go to the Battle Frontier. Once he finished, Gold and Crystal fell on top of the training room, having been defeated by Guile. Angered that he hurt Crystal, Emerald tried to attack Guile, but was defeated. When Guile reminded Emerald of his earlier statements of only liking, Emerald angrily admitted that he truly does love Pokémon as well as the people who love them. His words caused Jirachi’s third eye to open and grant his wish to revive the petrified Pokédex holders. In <i><a href=# title=PS334>The Final Battle VII</a></i>, the ten Pokédex holders gathered together for one final battle against Guile and his army of rental Pokémon. With the help of <a href=# title=Scott>Scott</a>, Todd, Latios, and Latias, Emerald created a giant field around the Battle Frontier that pacified all of Guile's rental Pokémon with soil from <a href=# title="Faraway Island">Faraway Island</a>. By utilizing a triple Frenzy Plant, Hydro Cannon, Blast Burn, and <a href=# title="Volt Tackle (move)">Volt Tackle</a> combination, the Kyogre sea monster was overloaded with energy and exploded, finally ending the conflict with Guile.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS337>Epilogue</a></i>, Emerald was congratulated by his allies on his victory against Guile. After receiving the Ability Symbol, Emerald realized there was only one day left to obtain the final Symbol and begged Tucker to let him challenge the Battle Dome again. Tucker allowed Emerald to compete, but without any other Trainers to join in the tournament, Emerald had to go up against his fellow Pokédex holders instead. As Jirachi went back to its thousand year slumber, Emerald thanked it for granting his wish to have friends. Afterward, Emerald competed in the Pokédex holder tournament, which he ended up winning, earning him the Tactics Symbol.</p><h3><span id=Omega_Ruby_.26_Alpha_Sapphire_arc></span><span class=mw-headline id=Omega_Ruby_&_Alpha_Sapphire_arc><a href=# title="Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire arc (Adventures)"><i>Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire</i> arc</a></span></h3><p>In the Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire arc, the Hoenn Pokédex holders were enlisted by <a href=# title="Steven Stone">Steven</a> and <a href=# title="Mr. Stone">Mr. Stone</a> to prevent a <a href=# title="Grand Meteor Delta">meteoroid</a> from crashing into the Earth and destroying it.

That night, Emerald encountered the mysterious Pokémon, <a href=# title="Hoopa (Pokémon)">Hoopa</a>, which couldn't be pacified by the soil from Faraway Island. Even with assistance from Steven and his Mega <a href=# title="Steven's Metagross">Metagross</a>, Hoopa managed to escape. The next day, Emerald and Sapphire assisted Steven and Mr. Stone by putting Sceptile and Chic on a machine known as an <a href=# title="Ultimate weapon">Absorber</a> and using the power of the Ultimate Moves in their Mega-Evolved forms. To their horror, the machine drained both Pokémon of their life energy to fuel a special device known as the dimensional shifter.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS604>Goodra Spits</a></i>, the <a href=# title="Draconid people">Draconid</a> <a href=# title=Zinnia>Zinnia</a> and a group of <a href=# title="Team Aqua Grunt (Trainer class)">Team Aqua</a> and <a href=# title="Team Magma Grunt (Trainer class)">Magma Grunts</a> attacked the Sea Mauville in order to destroy the dimensional shifter.

Using an illusion, Blaise and Amber bought themselves enough time to escape and allow Kyogre and Groudon to revert to their <a href=# title="Primal Reversion">Primal forms</a>. To Emerald and Ruby's shock, Archie and Maxie had returned and were the ones who gave Kyogre and Groudon the Orbs necessary for Primal Reversion. Using the super-ancient Pokémon's power, Archie and Maxie easily knocked Emerald and Ruby out of the sky before revealing that they also intended on stopping the meteoroid.</p><p>In <a href=# title=PS610>PS610</a>, Emerald and Ruby awakened at the <a href=# title="Meteor Village">Meteor Village</a>, the home of the Draconids. The village <a href=# title="Elder (Meteor Village)">Elder</a> revealed that Sapphire fought to protect the dimensional shifter, but lost and went missing. The Elder also allowed Archie and Maxie to train and teach Kyogre and Groudon moves necessary for stopping the meteoroid.

Latios rescued Zinnia and took her to <a href=# title="Sootopolis City">Sootopolis City</a> to recover from her injuries.
