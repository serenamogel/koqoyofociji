Braixen, however, attacked them and learned <a href=# title="Fire Blast (move)">Fire Blast</a> and defeated them after focusing her feelings, but in the process, shattering her stick. Pancham then showed a stick it had been holding onto to give to Braixen so that she could move on. Serena and her Pokémon put their hands together on the stick, making another promise to win the title of Kalos Queen, and Braixen accepted the new branch. Serena then put a bow on the branch as a sign of their promise. Serena and Woodward then continued their battle. Braixen avoided Gallade's Psycho Cut and then used her newly learned Fire Blast to deal serious damage on Gallade. Woodward then stopped the battle.

After being lifted up by Sylveon's <a href=# title="Fairy Wind (move)">Fairy Wind</a>, Braixen, Pancham, and Sylveon combined their moves once again to create a giant blooming fire flower. Their performance impressed the crowd. However, it was not enough to defeat the opposing team, formed by Aria, her Delphox, Aromatisse and <a href=# title="Vivillon (Pokémon)">Vivillon</a>, causing Aria to keep her title of Kalos Queen.</p><p>Braixen later helped to combat the giant roots that were growing over <a href=# title="Lumiose City">Lumiose City</a> in <i><a href=# title=XY132>A Towering Takeover!</a></i> after Team Flare launched their attack. Later, in <i><a href=# title=XY134>The Right Hero for the Right Job!</a></i> as Serena, <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a>, <a href=# title=Mairin>Mairin</a>, and Professor Sycamore approached <a href=# title="Lysandre Labs">Lysandre Labs</a>, Braixen defended the helicopter from <a href=# title=Mable>Mable</a>'s <a href=# title="Weavile (Pokémon)">Weavile</a>'s attacks. She later battled through numerous Team Flare Grunts and their pack of <a href=# title="Houndoom (Pokémon)">Houndoom</a>. In <a href=# title=XY135>the next episode</a>, Braixen was sent out to fight against the <a href=# title="Giant Rock">Giant Rock</a> to prevent it from reaching <a href=# title="Anistar City">Anistar City</a>'s <a href=# title="Anistar City">Sundial</a>. She <a href=# title=XY136>later</a> tried to fend off the roots to protect Serena, Mairin, and Bonnie. In <a href=# title=XY137>the following episode</a>, Braixen and the rest of Serena's Pokémon received medals from Professor Sycamore for their heroic efforts against Team Flare.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY138>The First Day of the Rest of Your Life!</a></i>, Braixen, along with her Trainer, Shauna, Jessie, and their respective Pokémon, performed for a crowd of Lumiose citizens. She was later used in a battle against Ash and Pikachu. Immediately, Braixen was hit by a speedy <a href=# title="Quick Attack (move)">Quick Attack</a>. Despite trying to block an incoming <a href=# title="Iron Tail (move)">Iron Tail</a> with her branch, the attack proved too strong. She then launched a Flamethrower, but Pikachu dodged the attack, after which the two Pokémon clashed with Scratch and Iron Tail. Braixen then fired off a Fire Blast, successfully hitting Pikachu. The battle was then called off by Ash.</p><p>When Serena left <a href=# title="Ash's friends">the group</a> to travel around <a href=# title=Hoenn>Hoenn</a>, Braixen departed with her, along with her teammates.</p><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Journeys:_The_Series></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Journeys:_The_Series><i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i></span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN105>Reuniting for the First Time!</a></i>, Braixen was revealed to have evolved into a Delphox at some point during Serena's travels through Hoenn. She participated in the <a href=# title="Lilycove City">Lilycove City</a> <a href=# title="Pokémon Contest">Pokémon Contest Spectacular</a> alongside her teammates, and was able to help Serena tie with <a href=# title=Lisia>Lisia</a> for first place.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Personality_and_characteristics>Personality and characteristics</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/6/68/Serena_and_Braixen.png/375px-Serena_and_Braixen.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Serena brushing Braixen's fur<p>As a Fennekin, Delphox took after her Trainer in many ways since they started journeying together. In <i><a href=# title=XY005>A Blustery Santalune Gym Battle!</a></i>, she mimicked Serena when she stretched out. She takes pride in her appearance and becomes upset when her fur or tail becomes mussed or dirty. In <i><a href=# title=XY011>The Bamboozling Forest!</a></i>, she thanked <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Froakie">Froakie</a> for cleaning her tail with the Frubbles on the <a href=# title="Water (type)">Water-type</a>'s back, and in <i><a href=# title=XY021>A Pokévision of Things to Come!</a></i>, she hesitated to escape from <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> because of a large muddy puddle that blocked her path, only changing her mind after seeing her Trainer start to run across the puddle to her side. Her unwillingness to become dirty was seen again in <i><a href=# title=XY022>Going for the Gold!</a></i> when she fled from a Corsola's <a href=# title="Water Gun (move)">Water Gun</a>.</p><p>Fennekin has a bit of a temper and gets angry quickly without thinking twice, as shown in <i><a href=# title=XY021>A Pokévision of Things to Come!</a></i> when she continuously tried to hit <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> with her Ember attack but got Ash instead. The same episode also showed that she is easily envious, becoming jealous of <a href=# title="Aria (anime)">Aria</a>'s Fennekin's performance on <a href=# title=Pokévision>Pokévision</a>, and when Ash and <a href=# title="Clemont's Chespin">Chespin</a> complimented the performance. The same behavior happened again in <i><a href=# title=XY064>Battling with Elegance and a Big Smile!</a></i>, when Fennekin got into an argument with Pancham after they was practicing for the next <a href=# title="Pokémon Showcase">Pokémon Showcase</a>. When Pancham insulted Fennekin, she angrily used Flamethrower but accidentally hit Serena instead. She then felt bad and calmed down afterward. However, she is friendly towards her Trainer and is affectionate towards her. After evolving in <i><a href=# title=XY064>Battling with Elegance and a Big Smile!</a></i>, she maintained this affection. She is also protective of both Serena and her friends. In <i><a href=# title=XY071>So You're Having a Bad Day!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=XY083>Over the Mountain of Snow!</a></i>, Braixen reacted to Clemont's excitement over <a href=# title="Clemontic Gear">his inventions</a> and Chespin's clumsiness in a similar way to her Trainer and Bonnie.</p><p>Fennekin has extremely similar interests as Serena. In <i><a href=# title=XY021>A Pokévision of Things to Come!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=XY026>A Battle by Any Other Name!</a></i>, she enjoyed cooking and dressing up, particularly with Serena, and has a liking for <a href=# title="Poké Puff">Poké Puffs</a> and other sweets such as macarons. In <i><a href=# title=XY011>The Bamboozling Forest!</a></i>, she also likes to snack on branches, characteristic of her species. As a Braixen, she is also choosy, gaining this trait indirectly from Serena after she promised to become <a href=# title="Pokémon Performer">Kalos Queen</a> by using her previous branch. As a result, she wasn't willing to give it up at first despite it being broken and having no other choice.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Appearance>Appearance</span></h3><table><tbody><tr><th>As a Fennekin</th><th>As a Braixen</th></tr><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Serena Fennekin.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/3a/Serena_Fennekin.png/375px-Serena_Fennekin.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Serena Braixen.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1f/Serena_Braixen.png/375px-Serena_Braixen.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_used>Moves used</span></h3><table class=roundy><tbody readability=2.3234624145786><tr readability=1.607476635514><td><table><tbody readability=1><tr readability=2><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Serena Fennekin Scratch.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/3f/Serena_Fennekin_Scratch.png/300px-Serena_Fennekin_Scratch.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td align=center>Using Scratch<br>as a Fennekin</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Serena Delphox Flamethrower.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e7/Serena_Delphox_Flamethrower.png/300px-Serena_Delphox_Flamethrower.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr><td>Using Flamethrower</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td class=roundy></td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2 class=roundy>A <b><span>†</span></b> shows that the move was used recently, unless all moves fit this case or there are fewer than five known moves.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_improvised>Moves improvised</span></h4><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Voice_actors>Voice actors</span></h3><p>Below are Delphox's speaking voices in <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> and <a href=# title="Meowth (Team Rocket)">Meowth</a>'s dream in <i><a href=# title=XY098>Dream a Little Dream from Me!</a></i>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Artwork>Artwork</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_manga>In the manga</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/a/a1/Serena_Fennekin_M17_manga.png1.5x decoding=async width=200 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/5/57/Serena_Braixen_M18_manga.png/270px-Serena_Braixen_M18_manga.png decoding=async width=180 height=255 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Movie_adaptations>Movie adaptations</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Delphox (Pokémon)">Delphox</a> appeared as a <a href=# title="Fennekin (Pokémon)">Fennekin</a> in the manga adaptation of <i><a href=# title="Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction (manga)">Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction</a></i>.
